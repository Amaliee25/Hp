<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

Call the SlackWebApiAsync
```java
SlackWebApiAsync.getService("YOUR_TOKEN").getApiTest(new ApiTestParams(), new Callback<ApiTestResponse>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call<ApiTestResponse> call, Response<ApiTestResponse> response) {
        if(response.isSuccessful()){
            Log.d(TAG, "Server response: " + response.message());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call<ApiTestResponse> call, Throwable t) {
        //Ops !!
    }
});
```
